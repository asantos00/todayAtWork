### Problem
In the last week I worked in a task that was the upload of people *profile pictures* to our app at work. It happens that we wanted to crop the picture before it goes to the server (mainly because of our mobile app). I searched for some minutes and found a lib that does a lot of things related with cropping and resizing images using canvas its name was [Cropper](https://github.com/fengyuanchen/cropper).
I wanted something simpler, as I wouldn't import a library that big for the simple work I needed so I've made a small set of functions, here's what I wanted to do:

1. Load and image from user PC
2. Preview that image to aknowledge the user how it was gonna look
3. Crop the image center and resize to a desired resolution
4. Send it to the server as multipart


### Load image

This is a pretty simple step, you just add an ```<input id="fileUploader" type=file />```

**Note:**
If you want to do a more stylish button that the HTML one (which you normally do in a web app) you just hide the input and then trigger the click event on it when the user clicks in your custom button.

```javascript
$('.veryPrettyButton').on('click', function(event){
	$('#fileUploader').click();
})
```

#### Preview the image (File API)

I wanted to preview the image in an image tag so I choose to convert the image to base64 (a format that modern browsers support as the *src* tag).

```javascript
// Instantiate the FileReader
var reader = new FileReader();

// Setup the on load event and call a function with the result (base64)
reader.onload = function (e) {
    previewImage(e.target.result);
};

// Call the readAsDataURL() sending in the file from the input
reader.readAsDataURL(file);
```

The *e.target.result* that is being sent to the *previewImage* function is a base64 converted image.

**Note:** 
To get the file from the input you can use 
`$('#fileUploader').get(0).files[0]`

Which returns a File with all his properties, ready to send through a **POST** to your server or to the *readAsDataURL* method from the *FileReader* instance.

#### Crop the image center
Small little function which resizes image and crops the center

*TODO*

#### Send it to the server as multipart

Converting from canvas to Blob

*TODO*
