### Problem
In the last week I worked in a task that was the upload of people *profile pictures* to our app at work. It happens that we wanted to crop the picture before it goes to the server (mainly because of our mobile app). I searched for some minutes and found a lib that does a lot of things related with cropping and resizing images using canvas its name was [Cropper](https://github.com/fengyuanchen/cropper).
I wanted something simpler, as I wouldn't import a library that big for the simple work I needed so I've made a small set of functions, here's what I wanted to do:
- Load and image from user PC
- Preview that image to aknowledge the user how it was gonna look
- Crop the image center and resize to a desired resolution
- Send it to the server as multipart
