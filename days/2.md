### Problem (accept and capture tags)
We have implemented the file upload at my job, and we're a Phonegap App so we have to implement the file upload through the input tag.
I found that Android and iOS phones have a "upload files dialog" which automatically sugests to open the file browser or the camera. The camera one is a very cool feature as it automatically takes the pic and attaches it to our input type file.

**Problem:** The suggested camera was the **video camera**, that obviously isn't what we were expecting. Searching the web for some minutes I found this [link](https://www.w3.org/TR/html-media-capture/#the-capture-attribute).
It explains the **accept** attribute where you can specify the **MIME** types you want for file uploading, which was the fix I needed.
It also mentions the **capture** attribute which should automatically open the camera but as far as I know the behaviour is not consistent across browsers.

``` html
<input type="file" name="image" accept="image/*" capture>
```
