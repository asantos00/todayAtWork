### Sugestion (JSDOC and SpeakingJS)
At my job we have some Javascript code (a phonegap App and Desktop one) and the two are **Backbone based**, using the [Backbone Generator](https://github.com/yeoman/generator-backbone) from [Yeoman](https://github.com/yeoman) with **RequireJS** and **SASS**.
As you can expect, the code is not as documented as I expected and at the moment that is not a problem. The problem is when you have to introduce a new developer to the code.

You have to choose one of two possibilities:
- Let the developer bang his head on the walls for two weeks
- Take a lot of time introducing the new developer to the code and be available to answer a lot of questions for weeks

As I'm tired of answering questions and seeing my colleague banging with his head I obviously decided to gradually start documenting our code. I knew about **JSDoc** in [SpeakingJS](http://speakingjs.com/) which is a very well written book about JS, I've not read the whole book but I read some chapters and only have good things to say about it.
I will be posting here problems and tricks to work with **JSDoc**.

The script below, is in the [SpeakingJS](http://speakingjs.com/), and I'm only pasting this here to illustrate what JSDoc is
``` javascript
/** @namespace */
var util = {
    /**
     * Repeat <tt>str</tt> several times.
     * @param {string} str The string to repeat.
     * @param {number} [times=1] How many times to repeat the string.
     * @returns {string}
     */
    repeat: function(str, times) {
        if (times === undefined || times < 1) {
            times = 1;
        }
        return new Array(times+1).join(str);
    }
};
```
