# todayAtWork


Remember those books we bought in kids that were like **The Games Bible** where you had all the *cheats, tricks and missions* of a game solved?
I want this repo to be like that but for **problems people have been finding all over the years developing web apps**.

It's a repository where I will be posting the problems and sugestions I found everyday at work and its solutions or fixes.
It may be a real problem solution or a simple trick or note. Every problem, fix or tip will be posted as a *day* just because.

If you want to contribute with tips and fixes, feel free!

(As you will see, there is a lot of markdown here, I'm using the [Markdown Cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) from adam-p, I think it is pretty known but it's always worth to mention and to say thanks)

I'm pretty sorry for all the typos and grammar errors, feel free to correct them as one of this repo objectives is to improve my english too.
